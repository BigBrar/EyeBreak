# EyeBreak

EyeBreak is an automated desktop application designed to protect your eyes from digital strain by implementing the 20-20-20 rule. In today's screen-dominated world, our eyes are constantly under stress from prolonged computer and device usage. EyeBreak serves as your personal eye health companion, automatically reminding you to take regular breaks and look away from your screen at optimal intervals.

## The 20-20-20 Rule

The 20-20-20 rule is a simple yet highly effective guideline recommended by eye care professionals to prevent digital eye strain. The rule states:

- **Every 20 minutes** of screen time
- **Take a 20-second break**
- **Look at something 20 feet away**

This practice helps relax the eye muscles, reduce fatigue, and prevent long-term vision problems associated with extended screen use.
